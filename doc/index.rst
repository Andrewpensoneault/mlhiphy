   \begin{abstract}
   This work concerns the implementation and analysis of parameter-estimation in PDE using Gaussian Processes. 
   Given data from two black-box functions $u(x)$ and $f(x)$, we are interested in estimating the parameter $\phi$ in a linear transformation $\mathcal{L}_x^{\phi}$ such that $f(x) = \mathcal{L}_x^{\phi} u(x)$.
