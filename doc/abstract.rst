Abstract 
========

Check out maybe file:///C:/Users/SurfaceAdmin/Documents/TUM%20Master/Data%20Innovation%20Lab/Max%20Planck%20Institute%20for%20Plasma%20Physics/Gaussian%20Processes%20-%20Raissi.pdf for this.

This work concerns the implementation and analysis of parameter-estimation in PDE using Gaussian Processes. 
Given data from two black-box functions :math:`u(x)` and :math:`f(x)`, we are interested in estimating the parameter :math:`\phi` in a linear transformation :math:`\mathcal{L}_x^{\phi}` such that 

.. math::

	f(x) = \mathcal{L}_x^{\phi} u(x).
